References in a manuscript, thesis, and dissertation are all set up in exactly the same formatting. What may differ are the margins. Manuscripts, in APA 6th edition, are set at one inch margins whereas theses and dissertations typically have a 1.5 inch margin on the left side, for binding purposes. If you follow these steps and screenshots in formatting your references, your references will be properly created so that even if your margins are later changed, the formatting will remain correct.</emphasis></para>
